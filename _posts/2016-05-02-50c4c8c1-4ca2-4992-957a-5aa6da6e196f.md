description: 'I had the great joy and honor of contributing one of the chapters (called “BAM (Business as Mission) to, in and through Diaspora”) to this ground-breaking global compendium on Diaspora Missiology, published last month, the latest in the Regnum Studies in Mission. All the contributors and editors (Drs. Sadiri Joy Tira and Tetsunao Yamamori) are world-class scholars and practitioners. I highly recommend you acquire this book, and absorb and practice its content. Great for churches, seminaries and universities, ministries that work with immigrants and refugees, and personal learning and reference. You can find out more here: http://amzn.to/1Z1fa4J.'
